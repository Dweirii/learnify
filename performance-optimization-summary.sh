echo "âœ… PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:"
echo ""
echo "1. ðŸ”‡ REDUCED DEBUG LOGGING:"
echo "   - Removed excessive logger.debug() calls in SSE events"
echo "   - Removed frequent logger.info() calls for routine operations"
echo "   - Only log errors and critical events now"
echo ""
echo "2. ðŸ“¡ SSE OPTIMIZATION:"
echo "   - Reduced Redis Pub/Sub debug logging"
echo "   - Only log when no connections exist (debug level)"
echo "   - Removed verbose event handling logs"
echo ""
echo "3. ðŸŽ¯ FRONTEND OPTIMIZATION:"
echo "   - Reduced useStreamList hook logging"
echo "   - Removed frequent connection status logs"
echo "   - Only log errors and critical reconnection events"
echo ""
echo "4. ðŸ”„ REDIS PUB/SUB OPTIMIZATION:"
echo "   - Removed debug logs for publish/receive operations"
echo "   - Only log connection status and errors"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“Š EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS:"
echo "   âœ… Faster homepage loading"
echo "   âœ… Reduced server CPU usage"
echo "   âœ… Less memory consumption"
echo "   âœ… Cleaner terminal logs"
echo "   âœ… Better user experience"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ§ª TESTING RESULTS:"
echo "   âœ… Homepage loads successfully"
echo "   âœ… No linting errors"
echo "   âœ… All functionality preserved"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ LOGGING STRATEGY:"
echo "   - ERROR: Critical failures and exceptions"
echo "   - WARN: Important issues that need attention"
echo "   - INFO: Important state changes (connections, major events)"
echo "   - DEBUG: Detailed debugging (only when needed)"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ’¡ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "   - Monitor performance in production"
echo "   - Adjust logging levels as needed"
echo "   - Consider implementing log rotation"
echo ""
echo "âœ… Performance optimization complete!"
