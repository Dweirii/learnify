echo "The webhook is failing because:"
echo "1. LiveKit webhooks require proper signature verification"
echo "2. The 'Bearer' token approach is not correct for LiveKit"
echo "3. LiveKit uses HMAC-SHA256 signature verification"

echo ""
echo "üìã PROPER LIVEKIT WEBHOOK AUTHENTICATION:"
echo ""

echo "LiveKit webhooks use:"
echo "1. Authorization header with 'Bearer' prefix"
echo "2. JWT token signed with API secret"
echo "3. Token contains webhook payload hash"

echo ""
echo "üîß SOLUTION:"
echo ""

echo "1. Check your LiveKit dashboard webhook configuration"
echo "2. Ensure webhook URL is: http://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/livekit"
echo "3. Verify API key and secret are correct"
echo "4. Test with real LiveKit webhook (not manual curl)"

echo ""
echo "üß™ ALTERNATIVE TEST:"
echo ""

echo "Instead of manual webhook testing:"
echo "1. Start a real stream using your app"
echo "2. Watch the server logs for webhook events"
echo "3. Check Inngest UI for function executions"
echo "4. Verify database updates in Prisma Studio"
