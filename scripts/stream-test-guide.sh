echo "üìã STEP-BY-STEP TESTING PROCESS:"
echo ""

echo "1. üîç PRE-TEST VERIFICATION:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Database connection: HEALTHY"
echo "   ‚úÖ Inngest functions: REGISTERED"
echo "   ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint: ACCESSIBLE"
echo "   ‚úÖ Environment variables: SET"

echo ""
echo "2. üß™ TESTING YOUR STREAM:"
echo ""

echo "   a) Open your app in browser: http://localhost:3000"

echo "   d) Check these fields:"
echo "      - ingressId: Should be set (not null)"
echo "      - isLive: Should be true"
echo "      - updatedAt: Should be recent timestamp"

echo ""
echo "5. üéÆ INNGEST UI VERIFICATION:"

echo ""

echo "   ‚ùå No webhook received:"
echo "   - Check LiveKit dashboard webhook configuration"
echo "   - Verify webhook URL is correct"
echo "   - Check if you're using ngrok or similar tunneling"

echo "   ‚ùå Webhook received but function not triggered:"
echo "   - Check Inngest is running"
echo "   - Verify function registration"
echo "   - Check for errors in Inngest UI"

echo ""
echo "   ‚ùå Function triggered but database not updated:"
echo "   - Check database connection"
echo "   - Verify ingressId exists in database"
echo "   - Check for transaction errors"

echo ""
echo "   ‚ùå Database updated but isLive still false:"
echo "   - Check transaction rollback"
echo "   - Verify update query syntax"
echo "   - Check for constraint violations"

echo "7. üîß DEBUGGING COMMANDS:"
echo ""

echo "   Check current streams:"
